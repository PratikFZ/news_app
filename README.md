# news_app

A new Flutter project.

Here are some important notes about the news app:

1. Error Handling & Null Safety:
   - All required fields have proper null safety handling
   - The app safely handles [Removed] content by filtering it out
   - DateTime parsing includes fallback to current time if invalid
   - Null-safe access implemented for nested JSON objects (source name)

2. Hive Implementation:
   - Proper setup with HiveObject extension for persistence
   - Custom TypeAdapter for Article model
   - DateTime adapter registration required for proper date storage
   - Fields are properly annotated with @HiveField tags

3. Data Processing:
   - Response body is properly decoded from JSON
   - Articles are filtered before conversion to Article objects
   - Efficient list processing using map and where functions
   - Default values provided for missing or invalid data

4. Best Practices Used:
   - Clean separation of model and adapter code
   - Factory pattern for JSON deserialization
   - Required vs optional fields clearly defined
   - Consistent error handling approach

5. Future Enhancement Possibilities:
   - Add pagination support
   - Implement caching strategy
   - Add error retry mechanism
   - Include refresh functionality
   - Add article search/filtering features
